    "## Part I: What does it mean to train an AI model?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no perfect answer in solving a problem using AI. There are many frameworks and methodology\n",
    "that differ by the details, but the starting point is to understand what is the problem, what are\n",
    "the data we have, and what is the goal to achieve using AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the context of medicine, an example problem could be to diagnose the patients given\n",
    "a set of symptoms, to screen diseases or disorders given patient\"s imaging data, or to discover\n",
    "new vaccine when the next pandemic arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below depicts one viewpoint of the machine learning lifecycle. It explains briefly the\n",
    "process of building an AI model to solve the predefined problem and to achieve the predefined goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1_dlG-Cju5ke-DKp8DQ9hiA@2x.jpeg\"\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**\n",
    "\n",
    "   We start by gathering relevant medical information like patient records, lab results, and imaging\n",
    "   scans. AI developers must understand the problem well, especially in the medical context, and\n",
    "   should find relevant data, or the resources, to build the AI solution efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning**\n",
    "\n",
    "   The raw data often contains errors, missing values, or inconsistencies that need fixing. We\n",
    "   carefully review and correct these issues to ensure the information is accurate and reliable for\n",
    "   analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering**\n",
    "\n",
    "   This is when *inductive bias* first comes in. Here we identify and organize the most important\n",
    "   pieces of medical data that do not exist originally in the data, but we complement them to help\n",
    "   AI become more accurate. For example, we might calculate BMI from height and weight measurements,\n",
    "   or track changes in lab values over time instead of given AI the raw values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Training**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The AI model learns to capture patterns from between the collected data and the task\"s goal\n",
    "    after AI developers provide a set of constraints or rules. For example, capturing the hidden\n",
    "    relationship between a protein and the docking site or recognizing the pattern between apneic\n",
    "    episode and the SpO2 signal. This AI model can also be large language models (LLM) that we hear\n",
    "    everyday in some specific tasks!\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "    After the model has learned from the data, we rigorously test its performance using metrics\n",
    "    doctors understand, like sensitivity and specificity. We also check for biases to ensure that\n",
    "    the patterns the model learned are fair and accurate across different patient groups before\n",
    "    clinical use.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Deployment**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Once validated, we integrate the model into hospital systems where it can assist with tasks like\n",
    "    flagging abnormal test results. This is done carefully with proper staff training and monitoring\n",
    "    protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Monitoring**\n",
    "\n",
    "    After launch, we continuously track the model\"s performance in real-world use. Just like medical\n",
    "    guidelines evolve, we update the models as we get new data or discover ways to improve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ongoing cycle helps create AI tools that truly support clinical work while maintaining safety\n",
    "and reliability. Your expertise remains essential for interpreting results and making final\n",
